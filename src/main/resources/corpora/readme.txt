Supposed to contain a tagged LVK2018 corpus file (lvk_201809042224.vert in this version) not included in git because of the size. I'm fetching it with the following command
scp korpuss:/data/nosketch_corpora/vert/lvk_201809042224.vert src/main/resources/corpora/

Now removed by default, as the new LVK2022 file is far too large and is used differently in production.
